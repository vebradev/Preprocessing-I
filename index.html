        <p>Born in 289 AC at Winterfell, Arya is the youngest daughter and third child of Lord Eddard Stark, the head of
          House Stark and Warden of the North, and Lady Catelyn Tully. Arya has an older sister, Sansa, an older
          brother, Robb, and two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon.</p>
        <p>Arya is a fiercely independent child who is unconstrained by social expectations like gender roles, courtly
          virtues, class distinctions, and the expectations of her parents and siblings. A tomboy, she never aspired to
          be a "proper lady" as her older sister Sansa did. Before the series of events that shatter her innocence and
          destroy her support system, Arya is full of life, and she makes others smile just by virtue of her spirited
          indifference to rules.</p>
